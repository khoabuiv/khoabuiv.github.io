# Finding the Paul Brown Number


## Introduction
The mathematician Paul Erdos was the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, publishing around 1500 mathematical papers. To measure his influence on mathematics, Erdos' peers defined the [Erdos number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd≈ës_number) to measure the collaborative distance between a mathematician and Erdos. For example:
- Erdos number 0: Erdos himself.
- Erdos number 1: Someone who wrote an article with Erdos.
- Erdos number 2: Someone who wrote an article with a person who has Erdos number 1.
- Erdos number n: Someone who wrote an article with a person who has Erdos number n-1.
