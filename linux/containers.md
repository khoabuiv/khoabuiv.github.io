# Containers 

- **Docker** is an application-level virtualization using many individual images to build up the necessary services to support the target application.
- Docker image components:
    - Application code​
    - Runtime libraries​
    - System tools​
Docker is that an application can be packaged up with all of its dependent code and services and deployed as a single unit with the minimum of overhead. 
- **docker compose**: allows you to specify runtime as well as build time configuration details for Docker containers using a YAML docker-compose.yml file.
